### Hi there üëã

My name is You-Jia Huang, I‚Äôm majoring in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (Was called NCTU) in Taiwan as a second year student.

I have 4 years experience in competitive programming, and I started my journey since my first year at high school.

I won first place two times at regional contests in the row, and at the last year, I entered the first stage of ‚ÄúTaiwan Olympiad in Informatics‚Äù which you can view it as USACO in the United State. And these achievements made me enter the NCTU, which is top2 university at Taiwan, without taking any tests.

After I entered the university, I joined a competitive programming club, PCCA. Each week, we spent 5 hours practicing competitive programming. Our team‚Äôs diligent work and perseverance got us to silver awards in the first two years at university.

At the mean time I joined our department‚Äôs computer center as WWW team TA. In this experience, I learned things about development and maintenance of web services from our department. And also the knowledge about software engineering such as Git flow, GitHub flow, and basic concept of CI/CD.

Besides my focus on professional knowledge, I also enjoy helping others. Using my knowledge to help beginners in my free time also brings me great satisfaction.
